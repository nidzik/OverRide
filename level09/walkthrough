When a username over 41 bytes is entered the program crashes.
The last char of the message buffer describes how much size is left in the buffer to copy the actual message.
If we cheat by replacing the original size of 140 by something else in the username, we can make the <strncpy> in <set_msg> copy more bytes than it should.
This means we can probably overwrite the %eip register of set_msg and redirect flow to the <secret_backdoor> function.
